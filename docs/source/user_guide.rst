Starting the DoubleBlind app
------------------------------




When you first start the DoubleBlind application, you will see a window with two tabs: "Blind data" and "Un-blind data". This is set up by the MainWindow class.

Blind Data
------------

In the "Blind data" tab, there is a feature to encode or "blind" your data. This is managed by the EncodeTab class. When you're ready to blind your data, you can click on what seems to be a "run" button and you will receive a message box indicating that the data was blinded successfully.

Un-blind Data
---------------

In the "Un-blind data" tab, you can decode or "un-blind" your data. This is managed by the DecodeTab class. Similar to the blind data tab, you can run the operation and receive a message box indicating that the data was un-blinded successfully.

Additional options
---------------------

On the top of the main window, you will find a menu bar with the options "View" and "Help".
